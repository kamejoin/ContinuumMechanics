# Continuum Mechanics

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks concerning the field of Continuum Mechanics and its computer applications. The theory is almost entirely copied from the book ["Continuum Mechanics for Engineers"](https://www.crcpress.com/Continuum-Mechanics-for-Engineers-Third-Edition/Mase-Smelser-Mase/p/book/9781420085389) by Mase, Smelser & Mase. The programming applications are selfmade. The principle of this notebooks is under no circumstances to make a copy of the reference book, but to develop my personal understanding of the field.
