# Continuum Mechanics

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks concerning the field of Continuum Mechanics and its computer applications. The theory is almost entirely copied from the book "Continuum Mechanics for Engineers" by Mase, Smelser & Mase. The programming applications are selfmade. The principle of this notebooks is under no circumstances to make a copy of the reference book, but to develop my personal understanding of the field.
